Project Onyx
Real-time Voice, Text, and Video Communication. Built by Gamers, for Everyone.


📌 What is Project Onyx?
Project Onyx is a next-generation real-time communications app designed to bring people together through seamless voice, video, and text. It includes a built-in feature called Pack Link, an in-game overlay that allows users to coordinate across multiple voice channels, making it perfect for large-scale raids, operations, or squad coordination.

Created and maintained by a solo developer with a vision for community-powered communication.
